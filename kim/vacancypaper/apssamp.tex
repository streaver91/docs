\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}

A longtime goal of scientists' is to be able to calculate the properties of materials from their structures accurately and efficiently.
There are several approaches to this problem, including the density functional theory (DFT) and the atomistic simulation.
DFT has developed rapidly in the recent few decades and achieved decent accuracy for many small-scale systems.
However, in many cases, the size, the complexity, or the timescale we want to simulate, demands a much more efficient method.
And atomistic simulation with good interatomic potentials is one of the methods that can fulfill this demand.

Several different types of interatomic models have been developed over the past few decades, from pairwise models, like Lennard-Jones, to those based on cluster functionals, such as the embedded-atom method (EAM) \cite{daw1993embedded, daw1984embedded}.
One problem that has hindered the development of atomistic simulation is that the models developed by various researchers are usually presented in different formats, making them difficult to be reused.
The OpenKIM project \cite{bierbaum2014openkim, openkim2016} solves this problem by providing a unified framework for model developers to submit, and for model users to perform atomistic simulations with these models \cite{tadmor2011potential}.
It also hosts a repository of reference data from other sources, such as DFT and experiments, for assessing the quality of these models.
% sample elements from the whole periodic table and various structures and find out or discover suitable materials and structures in an automated way, which in the past could only be done with DFT \cite{ceder2010opportunities, zhou2010iron,norskov2009towards} and thus was only applicable for small structures.

In this study, we focus on vacancies, the simplest and the most common point defects.
Finding interatomic models that can accurately describe vacancy effects is extremely beneficial for furthering our understanding and application of materials.
Vacancies affect dislocation climbing and creeping \cite{weertman1955theory}, mediate the diffusion of substitutional defects \cite{fahey1989point}, and are the dominant flow mechanism under external fields, such as gravity \cite{sethna2014flow}.
Also, some scientists are proposing using \ce{^{28}Si} for a new kilogram definition \cite{andreas2011counting}, and how to obtain the vacancy concentration accurately is a crucial part of this work.

In order to assess how each interatomic potential model performs in vacancy-related simulations, we calculated the most common monovacancy properties for all the elements and all the simple crystal structures predicted by the interatomic potential models available on OpenKIM at this time.
The properties we calculated includes the vacancy formation energy (VFE), the vacancy migration energy (VME), the vacancy relaxation volume (VRV), the elastic dipole tensor (EDT), the defect strain tensor (DST), and the saddle point elastic dipole tensor (SPEDT) and defect strain tensor (SPDST).
The OpenKIM website properties page \url{https://openkim.org/properties} provides a brief description to these quantities.
Sec.~\ref{sec:method} describes how we perform the calculation.
The structures we calculated includes sc, fcc, bcc, diamond, and hcp.
These results can be compared with data from other sources, such as the density function theory (DFT), the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), or the experiments, and provide use information when selecting interatomic models for vacancy-related simulations.
They can also be used with continuous models to obtain an initial guess for further atomistic simulations \cite{bozhevolnyi2001multiple}.
In this paper, we compared our VFE and VME results for fcc and hcp structures to DFT calculations and experiments \cite{angsten2014elemental}.
We found that EAM potential models, in general, provide results closer to these reference data then other models at this time, especially for transition metals.

In addition, we explored how these properties relate to each other, and to other elemental properties, such as the cohesive energy and the bulk modulus.
Both the vacancy formation energy and the vacancy migration energy show a linear increasing trend to the cohesive energy, with slopes of $0.32\pm0.04$ and $0.14\pm0.04$ respectively.
Migration energy also shows a linear increasing trend to the bulk modules, with a slope of $(0.57\pm0.03)\angstrom^3$.
While the vacancy relaxation volume shows a linear decreasing trend, with a slope of $(-4.2\pm0.7)\angstrom^6\per\electronvolt$.
And finally, we found that the vacancy formation energy also decreases with the relaxation volume, with a slope of $(-0.14\pm0.02)\electronvolt\per\angstrom^3$.
All of these results are consistent with physics intuition and previous literatures.
These relationships can provide additional information in selecting models and screening structures.

The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:method} we describe the method for calculating the monovacancy properties.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:results} we show the plots of our results, compare them with the reference data, and explore how they relate to each other and to other elemental properties.
And Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this paper.

\section{\label{sec:method}Methodology}

In this section, we explain how we calculated the monovacancy properties, including the vacancy formation energy (VFE), the vacancy migration energy (VME), the vacancy relaxation volume (VRV), the elastic dipole tensor (EDT), the defect strain tensor (DST), and the saddle point elastic dipole tensor (SPEDT) and defect strain tensor (SPDST).
For a brief description of these quantities, you can check the OpenKIM website properties page \url{https://openkim.org/properties}.

The calculation is based on OpenKIM \cite{openkim2016} and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) \cite{bahn2002object}.
The code can be found in the OpenKIM repository with ID \lstinline{TD_000000000000}.
Here, we discuss the algorithm used for obtaining each of these quantities.

The free energy per unit volume of a crystal can be described by the following equation \cite{freedman2009elastic}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:f}
f = f_0 + n_dE_d + \frac{1}{2}n_d^2E_{dd} + \frac{1}{2}C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{ij}\epsilon_{kl} - n_d\epsilon_{ij}G_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $n_d$ is the defect concentration, $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the bulk strain, $E_d$ is the vacancy formation energy, $E_{dd}$ describes the energy from defect interaction, $C_{ijkl}$ is the elastic stiffness tensor, and $G_{ij}$ is the elastic dipole tensor.
$f_0$ is the chemical potential, and suppose $n$ is the number of atoms per unit volume and $E_0$ is the cohesive energy per atom corresponding to a perfect crystal (what we defined as the reservoir), then $f_0 = (n - n_d) E_{0}$.

The negative direvative of $f$ with respect to $n_d$ under zero strain gives vacancy formation energy
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:VFE0}
  \mathit{VFE} = E_d = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial n_d}\right|_{\epsilon = 0} + E_{0} - n_d E_{dd}
\end{equation}
Numerically, we used the supercell approach.
For a supercell of volume $V_0$ with a monovacancy, Eq.~(\ref{eq:VFE0}) is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  (E_{V_0, d} - E_{V_0}) + E_{0} = \mathit{VFE} + \frac{E_{dd}}{V_0} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \mathit{g}(V_0)
\end{equation}
Here $E_{V_0, d}$ and $E_{V_0}$ are the free energy of the supercell with and withouth the defect respectively.
And we defined the expression in the middle as $g(V_0)$, thus $\mathit{VFE} = g(\infty)$.
We obtained this $g(\infty)$ through extrapolation.
The uncertainty of this value is the root sum square of the uncertainty from the extrapolation and the uncertainty from the atomistic relaxation.

The negative derivative of $f$ with respect to strain gives the stress
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:stress}
  \sigma_{ij} = -\frac{\partial f}{\partial \epsilon_{ij}}
  = -C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{kl} + n_dG_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}n_d^2\frac{\partial E_{dd}}{\partial \epsilon_{ij}}
\end{equation}
And the derivative of $\sigma_{ij}$ with respect to $n_d$ with fixed strain $\epsilon_0$ gives the elastic dipole tensor
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:EDT}
  G_{ij} = \left.\frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial n_d}\right|_{\epsilon = \epsilon_0}
  + n_d \left.\frac{\partial E_{dd}}{\partial \epsilon_{ij}}\right|_{\epsilon = \epsilon_0}
\end{equation}
Similarly, we obtained the value and the uncertainty of EDT through extrapolation.

The defect strain tensor $\Lambda_{ij}$ is obtained by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DST}
  \Lambda_{ij} = S_{ijkl} G_{kl}
\end{equation}
where $S_{ijkl}$ is the elastic compliance tensor, which is the inverse of the elastic stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$.

The relaxation volume, VRV, is the decrease in the volume of the material due to the monovacancy.
There are two methods for calculating this quantity.
One is through relaxing both the positions of the atoms and the size of the supercell.
And the other is through its relationship with the defect strain tensor.
For an orthorhombic supercell
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:VRV}
  \mathit{VRV} = V_0\epsilon_{ii} = \Lambda_{ii}
\end{equation}
We verified that these two methods give consistent results.
Since the second method does not involve additional relaxation, we used that one in our calculation.
Note that the supercells used in our calculation for different structures are all orthorhombic cells.
For sc, fcc, bcc, and diamond structures, we used the conventional cubic cell as the basis for constructing supercells, and for hcp structures, we used the one with lattice vectors $(a, \sqrt{3}a, c)$ as the basis.

For vacancy migration, we used nudged elastic band method to obtain the migration path and cubic spline interpolation to obtain the saddle point energy and configuration.
We used similar extrapolation method to obtain the vacancy migration energy (VME) and the saddle point elastic dipole tensor and defect strain tensor.
Since the configuration of the saddle point is still a monovacancy, the quantities shall scale in the same way with respect to the number of atoms.

Property values normalized by the extrapolated values versus the inverse of the number of atoms in a supercell.
These values are calculated for fcc aluminum with the embedded atom model (EAM) from Mishin and Farkas \cite{mishin1999interatomic}.
The migration path is from (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to (0.5, 0.5, 0.0) in a conventional fcc unit cell.
VFE is the vacancy formation energy, VME is the vacancy migration energy, VRV is the vacancy relaxation volume, EDT is the elastic dipole tensor, DST is the defect strain tensor, and SP stands for the saddle point of the migration.
The two numbers following the tensor are the row and column indices.
Since VRV and DST11 are all proportional to EDT11, they will appear as the same curve after normalization, we only show EDT11 here.
EDT22 and EDT33 are the same as EDT11, and all the off-diagonal terms of EDT are zero.
So does DST.
The linear relationship shown in this figure validates our extrapolation.
In order to keep the graph clear, the error bars are not shown here.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:extrapolation}, we plot the normalized property values for fcc aluminum versus the number of atoms in a supercell, calculated with the embedded atom model (EAM) by Mishin and Farkas \cite{mishin1999interatomic}.
The linear relationship shown in this figure validates our extrapolation.

The calculated results can be found in the OpenKIM repository \cite{openkim2016}.
Appendix~\ref{app:data} provides scripts for retrieving these results.

A key quantity in these results that distinguishes different vacancies and migrations is the position of the vacancy.
In the simplest case where symmetry is preserved, this is unambiguously the position of the center of the symmetry.
However, in general, there is no clear definition for the position of a vacancy in the literature yet.
Therefore, we provide one here:
The position of the vacancy (or any point defect) is the point, where, if we characterize the effect of the defect as a series of force multipoles at this point, the diagonal terms of the force quadruple are zero in the basis that diagonalizes the force dipole.
Appendix~\ref{app:position} provides a more detailed explanation of this definition.

% Fig.~\ref{fig:VFEFitting} is a plot of VFE versus $1/n$, calculated with the EAM model of aluminum from Mishin and Farkas \cite{mishin1999interatomic}.
% In this case, $A_0 = \unit{0.67515(1)}{\electronvolt}$ and $A_3 = \unit{-0.3644(27)}{\electronvolt}$, which implies that the monovacancy formation energy is \unit{0.67515(1)}{\electronvolt}.
% The linear relationship shown in this figure and the adjusted R-square of 0.99978 in the fitting validate our extrapolation.

%
%
% We first obtain the lattice constants through energy minimization, and then use this value to build several periodically repeated supercells of different sizes.
% For each supercell, we use the following algorithm to obtain the desired properties:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Obtain the potential energy and volume of this supercell, $E_0$ and $V_0$.
%  \item Remove an atom, relax the positions of the other atoms (keep the size of the supercell fixed) and obtain the new potential energy, $E_1$.
%  \item Calculate the vacancy formation energy by:
%  \begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:vfecalc}
%  \mathit{VFE} = E_1 - E_0 \times \frac{n - 1}{n}
%  \end{equation}
%  where $n$ is the number of atoms in the original supercell.
%  \item Move one atom to the vacant site from the nearest neighbors and use the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to obtain the saddle point energy, $E_2$.
%  \item Calculate the vacancy migration energy by:
%  \begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:vmecalc}
%  \mathit{VME} = E_2 - E_1
%  \end{equation}
%  \item Relax the size of the supercell and obtain the relaxation volume.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% Finally, we extrapolate these results to get the dilute limit.
% The extrapolation is based on the elastic theory \cite{landau2013course}, according to which all the quantities that we are interested in scale approximately as
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:extrapolation}
% A_0 + \frac{A_3}{n}
% \end{equation}
% where $n$ is the number of atoms in a supercell \cite{freysoldt2014first}, and $A_0$ and $A_3$ are the constants to be determined.
% $A_0$ is the dilute limit we want.
%
% We can prove this scaling relationship as follows:
% first of all, $n\propto R^3$, where $R$ is the size of the supercell, so Eq.~(\ref{eq:extrapolation}) is equivalent to $A_0+A_3/R^3$.
% For simplicity, we ignore anisotropy and nonlinearity, and consider the supercell with a vacancy as a hollow sphere.
% According to the elastic theory, the displacement vector of a hollow sphere of external and internal radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ with a pressure $p_1$ inside and $p_2$ outside is $\vec{u} = \left(ar + b / r^2\right)\hat{r}$, where
% \begin{align}
% a &= \frac{p_1R_1^3-p_2R_2^3}{R_2^3-R_1^3}\cdot\frac{1-2\sigma}{E}\\
% b &= \frac{R_1^3R_2^3(p_1-p_2)}{R_2^3-R_1^3}\cdot\frac{1+\sigma}{2E}
% \end{align}
% Here $\sigma$ is the Poisson's ratio, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $p_2=0$, and, for VRV, $r=R_2$. Hence, we can get the $r$ component of $\vec{u}$
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ur}
% u_r = \frac{p_1R_1^3}{R_2^2}\cdot\frac{3\left(1-\sigma\right)}{2E}\left(1+\frac{R_1^3}{R_2^3}+O\left(\frac{1}{R_2^6}\right)\right)
% \end{equation}
% Therefore, the vacancy relaxation volume
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:VRVProof}
% \begin{split}
% \mathit{VRV} & = \frac{4}{3}\pi\left(R_2^3-(R_2-u_r)^3\right)\\
%  & = 4\pi C_0\left(1 + \frac{R_1^3-C_0}{R_2^3} + O\left(\frac{1}{R_2^6}\right)\right)
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% Here $C_0 = 3p_1R_1^3(1-\sigma)/2E$ is a constant.
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:VRVProof}) indicates that VRV satisfies Eq.~(\ref{eq:extrapolation}).
%
% The strain and the stress of the hollow sphere are
% \begin{align}
% u_{rr} &= a - 2b/r^3\\
% u_{\theta\theta} = u_{\phi\phi} &= a + b/r^3\\
% \sigma_{rr} &= \frac{pR_1^3}{R_2^3-R_1^3}\cdot \left(1-\frac{R_2^3}{r^3}\right)\\
% \sigma_{\theta\theta}=\sigma_{\phi\phi} &= \frac{p_1R_1^3}{R_2^3-R_1^3}\cdot\left(1+\frac{R_2^3}{r^3}\right)
% \end{align}
% From these we can obtain the vacancy formation energy
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:VFEProof}
% \begin{split}
% \mathit{VFE} & = \iiint_V \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{rr}\sigma_{rr} + u_{\theta\theta}\sigma_{\theta\theta} + u_{\phi\phi}\sigma_{\phi\phi}\right) dV\\
%  & = 4C_1(1+\sigma)
%  + 2C_1 C_2 \cdot\frac{R_1^3}{R_2^3}
%  + O\left(\frac{1}{R_2^6}\right)
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% where $C_1=p_1^2\pi R_1^3/(3E)$ and $C_2 = 5-4\sigma+(6\sigma-3) \log\left(R_1/R_2\right)$.
% This proves that VFE scales approximately as Eq.~(\ref{eq:extrapolation}).
%
% Note that, for efficiency, our calculation of VFE is performed with a fixed-size supercell, not a stress-free one.
% This will not affect the results, because the difference between the results from the two different boundary conditions is
% \begin{equation}
% \Delta E=\int pdV=\int B \frac{V-V_0}{V_0}dV\propto\frac{(V-V_0)^2}{V_0}
% \end{equation}
% where the numerator is $\mathit{VRV}^2=16\pi C_0^2+O(R_2^{-3})$, and the denominator is proportional to $R_2^3$.
% This means $\Delta E$ also scales as $1/R_2^3$.
%
% VME is the energy difference between two configurations:
% a crystal with a monovacancy, and a crystal with two monovacancies adjacent to each other and an extra atom somewhere between the two vacant sites.
% The energy of the first configuration has just been proved to scale as Eq.~(\ref{eq:extrapolation}).
% The second configuration can be considered as a superposition of three states:
% two states correspond to the initial and final states of the migration, and the third one corresponds to the saddle point but with the two vacant sites filled up.
% The proof of VFE can be applied directly to each of these states and give similar $R_2$ dependencies.
% Therefore, VME also satisfies Eq.~(\ref{eq:extrapolation}).
%
% Fig.~\ref{fig:VFEFitting} is a plot of VFE versus $1/n$, calculated with the EAM model of aluminum from Mishin and Farkas \cite{mishin1999interatomic}.
% In this case, $A_0 = \unit{0.67515(1)}{\electronvolt}$ and $A_3 = \unit{-0.3644(27)}{\electronvolt}$, which implies that the monovacancy formation energy is \unit{0.67515(1)}{\electronvolt}.
% The linear relationship shown in this figure and the adjusted R-square of 0.99978 in the fitting validate our extrapolation.

\section{\label{sec:results}Results and Discussion}

All the results calculated in this work are available in the OpenKIM repository \cite{openkim2016} and can be either viewed directly on the website or downloaded through OpenKIM Query with the scripts provided in Appendix~\ref{app:data}.

In this section, we first compare these results with the reference data to see how these models perform in general.
And then explore how these quantities related to each other and to other elemental properties.

\subsection{\label{sec:calcvsref}Calculated Results Versus Reference Data}

Fig.~\ref{fig:compare} compares our results and with the reference data from DFT calculations and experiments.
% The red dots and the blue dots in these figures represent the reference data from DFT calculations and experiments, respectively.
% The black symbols represent the results from atomistic simulations.
% The type of the interatomic model is indicated by the shape of the symbol: the circles represent the embedded-atom method (EAM), the triangles represent the pairwise models, and the cross signs represent all the other types of models, such as the three-body models.

\end{figure*}

We can see from these figures that the EAM models, in general, produce similar VFE and VME as DFT calculations and experiments.
While most pairwise models tend to produce larger values for VFE, especially for elements with Mendeleev numbers ranging from 25 to 45, which correspond to the transition metals and the post-transition metals.

To further explore how pairwise models come up with larger VFEs, we used fcc aluminum as an example and looked into the relationships between its cohesive energy $E_0$, unrelaxed vacancy formation energy $E_u$, and relaxed vacancy formation energy $E_r$.
We found that, with a pairwise potential (Morse), $E_0 = 2.70\electronvolt \approx E_u$.
While with an EAM potential (Mishin and Farkas), $E_0 = 3.36\electronvolt$, $E_u = 0.77\electronvolt \approx 0.2E_0 < E_0$.
The energy change due to relaxation, $|E_u-E_r|$, is much smaller than $E_u$ in both cases, and thus can be ignored.
We cursorily tested a few other transition metals and found similar relationships.
Therefore, the overestimation of VFE is mostly due to the incorrect estimation of the total energy when the coordination number in the neighborhood of the vacancy changes.

Besides the EAM models, there are also several models in our database that, although only supports a few elements, do give accurate results.
For example, the three-body potentials give decent results for diamond silicon.

In addition, several new models are also under active development and will be added into the OpenKIM repository soon, such as ...
The results for new models will be calculated automatically by the system once they are added.

%
%
% the reason for the overestimation of VFE is likely to be that pairwise potentials could not give correct cohesive energy when there are changes in bond structures.
%
% tested that for Al, with Pair Morse potential, the cohesive energy is 2.70 eV, equals exactly to the unrelaxed formation energy, the relaxed formation energy is 2.43 eV, so the relaxation energy is 2.70 - 2.43 = 0.27 eV; With an EAM potential, the cohesive energy is 3.36 eV, while the unrelaxed formation energy is only 0.77 eV, different from cohesive energy. The relaxed formation energy is 0.68 eV, so the relaxation energy is 0.09 eV, smaller than the Pair Morse counterparts
%
% One explanation for the pairwise models to get larger VFE could be that pairwise models assume the strength of the bonds only depend on the distance between the two atoms and unable to account for the fact that the change in the number of bonds can also affect the strength of the bonds, and thus the energy.
%
% To see this in detail, we exam the unrelaxed vacancy formation energy, $\mathit{UnrelaxedVFE}$, which the vacancy formation energy without position relaxation.
% It consists of three parts, which can be expressed by
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:vfedecomp}
% \mathit{UnrelaxedVFE} = N\cdot E_{bond} + \sum\Delta E_{bond} - E_{coh}
% \end{equation}
% where $N$ is the number of bonds surrounding each atom.
% The first term corresponds to the breaking of the bonds between the vacant site and its nearest neighbors.
% We ignore the contribution from breaking the bonds between the vacant site and its second nearest neighbors because it is much smaller than the first term.
% The second term corresponds to the energy change in the remaining bonds.
% And the third term is the cohesive energy, corresponding to the $n-1$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:vfecalc}), which also equals to $N\cdot E_{bond}/2$, as the energy of each bond is shared between the two atoms it connects.
% For all the pairwise models, we shall have $\mathit{UnrelaxedVFE}\approx E_{coh}$, as $\sum\Delta E_{bond}$ is zero; while for all the models that do take changes in the surrounding environment into consideration besides the distance between two atoms, we shall have $\mathit{UnrelaxedVFE}$ significantly different from $E_{coh}$.
% In Table~\ref{tab:cohvfe} we show our verification: the pairwise models do get similar values for $\mathit{UnrelaxedVFE}$ and $E_{coh}$, while other types of models get significantly different values.

% ===(Draft of draft below this line)===
%
% In Table~\ref{tab:cohvfe}, we show an example of fcc copper: as we move the atom next to the vacant slight away from the original position, the change in the cohesive energy according to the EAM potential is about 40\% smaller than the value according to the pairwise potential.
% This implies that as we create vacancy and remove bonds, the strength of the remaining bonds may decrease.
% We propose that the vacancy formation energy can be expressed as
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:vfedecomp}
% \mathit{VFE} = E_{cohesive} + \Delta E_{bonds, all} + \Delta E_{relaxation}
% \end{equation}
% Where $\Delta E_{bonds, all}$ is the change in the bond energy and the $\Delta E_{relaxation}$ is the change in energy due to position relaxation.
% When we remove an atom, all the bonds associated with that atom are also removed, which means the energy change is $n \times E_{bond}$, where $n$ is the number of bonds surround each atom and $E_{bond}$ is the energy of a single bond.
% Since each bond is associated with two atoms, thus the cohesive energy, $E_{cohesive}$, of an atom shall be the energy of half of the bonds associated with the atom, that is $n \times E_{bond}/2$.
% Compare with Eq.~(\ref{eq:vfecalc}), we can get the first $E_{cohesive}$ term in Eq.~\ref{eq:vfedecomp}.
% For pairwise potentials, $\Delta E_{bonds, all}$ is zero and $\Delta E_{relaxation}$ is usually much smaller than $E_{cohesive}$, so the vacancy formation energy according to them will be very close to the cohesive energy.
% This can be verified with our data.
% For example, with a pairwise potential for fcc copper, we will get the cohesive energy is 3.27 eV and the vacancy formation energy is 3.02 eV. We have also verified that without relaxation (no $\Delta E_{relaxation}$), the unrelaxed vacancy formation energy is also 3.27 eV, same as $E_{cohesive}$.

%
% For pairwise potentials, the bond energy per atom increase linearly with the number of bonds.
% However, experiments show there is a quadratic relationship between them.
% This implies that when we remove a bond, the strength of the remaining bonds will be weakened.
% Therefore, the change in energy during position relaxation will be smaller than if the bond strength remains the same.
% And this change in energy is exactly the main component of the vacancy formation energy.
%
% Other types of potentials sometimes also produce accurate results but are only available to a few elements.
% This suggests that right now in general EAM is the most promising method for describing vacancy effects.
% We believe there are several reasons why EAM outperforms other methods:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item EAM incorporates the multibody effects, which is crucial for describing the interaction between atoms.
% \item The training data for the EAM potentials usually includes both experimental data and DFT calculation results.
% \item For the EAM potentials, most of the information contained in the training data is kept into the potential models, while for other fixed-form potentials, lots of information is lost during the fitting process.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% In Table~\ref{tab:bestmodels}, we list the models currently available on OpenKIM that are most consistent with DFT and experiments.
% They are selected based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), a measure of prediction accuracy of models used in statistics, which in this case is defined as the average relative error to our reference data
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:mape}
% \mathit{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i\left|\frac{C_i-R_i}{R_i}\right|
% \end{equation}
% Here $n$ is the number of reference data available for the items we successfully calculate, $C_i$ is the calculated value, and $R_i$ is the reference value.
% The value of $\mathit{MAPE}$ for each model in this table is shown in column 4.
% Note that in our reference data, the mean absolute percentage error between the DFT results and experimental results is 27.87\%.
% Comparing to this, we can see that for most of the elements in this table, there exists a potential that can produce reasonably accurate results.
% These potentials are all good candidates for atomistic simulation when vacancy effects are significant.
%
% We can also see from these two tables that for nearly all the elements that have EAM potentials, the EAM potentials are selected as the best models in Table~\ref{tab:bestmodels} according to the criteria above.
% Only in very few cases, other types of potentials perform better than the EAM potentials.
% This is consistent with our previous analysis.

\subsection{\label{sec:calcvsprop}Relationships Between Properties}

The relationship between these vacancy properties and other elemental properties can provide additional information for choosing atomistic models and screening structures:
we shall be carefull when the model we are going to use give results that are inconsistent with these relationships;
and when the calculation of the vacancy properties are too time-consuming, we may use the information from other properties to filter out some structures.

Previous literatures have shown that the vacancy formation and migration energies are strongly correlated with the cohesive energy and the bulk modulus.
We verify these findings and further explore other relationships here with the EAM models we have and fcc structures.

Vacancy formation and migration energy versus cohesive energy.
These are calculated with EAM models for fcc structures.
As we can see, there is a linearly upward trend for both quantities.
The fitted slope for the formation energy and the migration energy are $0.32\pm0.04$ and $0.14\pm0.04$, respectively.
}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:vfevmevscoh} shows the relationship between the vacancy formation and migration energies and the cohesive energy.
We can see there is a linear increasing trend between the vacancy-related energies and the cohesive energy.
For the relationship between the vacancy formation energy and the cohesive energy, the slope is $0.32\pm0.04$, which agrees well with a previous DFT study, which gives a slope of $0.317$ \cite{angsten2014elemental}.
For the relationship between the vacancy migration energy and the cohesive energy, the slope is $0.14\pm0.04$, which is also similar to the DFT result, $0.191$.

}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:vmevsbulk} shows the relationship between the vacancy migration energy and the bulk modulus.
We can see there is also a linearly increasing trend.
The slope of the fitted line is $(0.57\pm0.10)~\angstrom^3 = (3.5\pm0.6)~\electronvolt\per\mathrm{GPa}$, which is qualitatively the same but quantitatively a little bit smaller than the DFT prediction, $5.5~\electronvolt\per\mathrm{GPa}$.

\caption{\label{fig:vrvvsbulk}

These are calculated with EAM models for fcc structures.
As we can see, there is a linearly downward trend.
The fitted slope and intercept are $(-4.2\pm0.7)~\angstrom^6\per\electronvolt$ and $(6.8\pm0.6)~\angstrom^3$, respectively.
}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:vrvvsbulk} shows the relationship between the vacancy relaxation volume and the bulk modulus.
% We expected that as the bulk modulus increases, the effect on the bulk strain due to the internal pressure created by the vacancy becomes smaller.
And we can see from the figure that there is a linear downward trend, which is consistent with the intuition that as the material becomes more stiff, the shrink due to the internal stress created by the vacancy decreases.
The slope of the fitted line is $(-4.2\pm0.7)~\angstrom^6\per\electronvolt$.

}
\end{figure}

We also found there is a strong correlation between the vacancy formation energy and the vacancy relaxation volume.
Fig.~\ref{fig:vfevsvrv} shows the relationship.
The slope of the fitted line is $(-0.14\pm0.02)~\electronvolt\per\angstrom^3$.
This downward trend is also consistent with the intuition that the energy needed for the vacancy to pull the neighboring atoms towards itself decreases with the help of additional bulk strain.

The results above are from fcc structures.
We summarize the results for the other structures in Table~\ref{tab:relation}.

\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusion}

In this study, we try to solve the problem of assessing the quality of interatomic models currently available in the OpenKIM repository \url{https://openkim.org/intro-models/} in terms of their ability to describe vacancy-related properties.

We developed tests using the OpenKIM API to perform the atomistic calculation and obtain the most important monovacancy properties for all the interatomic models in the OpenKIM repository and all the simple structures.

Then, we compare the calculated data with the reference data from DFT and experiments.
The results show that at this time, the EAM potentials, in general, agree with DFT calculations and experiments better than other kinds of potential models in the repository.
The pairwise potentials tend to overestimate the vacancy formation energy for transition metals and post-transition metals.
One caveat to note is that neither the DFT results nor the experiments are assured to be accurate.
It is always beneficial to have more accurate and more comprehensive reference data from other sources to compare our results with.

And finally, we looked into how these properties related to each other and to other elemental properties.
We got consistent results with previous studies, which further proved the reliability of our results and these relationships.
These relationships can provide additional information for choosing models and screening structures.

% \section{\label{sec:conclusion}Future Works}
%
% First of all, more accurate reference data will be extremely beneficial for improving the accuracy of our assessment.
% This may be done by improvements in the algorithm used in DFT calculations or the procedure used in experiments.
% The usage of other computational methods, such as quantum chemistry methods or quantum Monte Carlo may also help.
%
% In addition, the way we select the best models also worth further exploration.
% The measure used in this study is the mean absolute percentage error, which is widely used but has some biases \cite{mayer1993statistical}.
% It is possible that through some statistical analysis we can get a more suitable measure for this specific situation, and select the best model to perform the calculation we need accordingly, or select multiple models to perform the same calculation and assigning different weight to the result produced by each model accordingly and calculate the weighted average as the final result \cite{frederiksen2004bayesian}.
%
% Finally, for models with tunable parameters, it would be beneficial to have a unified system that can give the best parameter set (or sets) based on the reference data and the requirement of the user.

\section{Point Defect Position Definition}
\label{app:position}
We model a point defect as a series forces exerted on neighboring atoms.
Let $\bm{F}^{v}$ be the body force exerted by the defect on atom $v$ situated at $\bm{l}^v$.
Then the displacement field can be written as
\begin{equation}
u_i(\bm{x}) = \sum_{v=1}^{N} g_{ij}(\bm{x}-\bm{l}^v) F_j^v
\end{equation}
$g_{ij}$ is the Green's function of a unit point force \cite{seifmultipolar,ting1997three}.

Expanding $u_i$ around an arbitrary point $\bm{x'}$, gives
\begin{multline}
u_i(\bm{x})
= g_{ij}(\bm{x}-\bm{x'}) P_j^{(0)}
 + \frac{\partial g_{ij}(\bm{x}-\bm{x'})}{\partial x_k'} P_{kj}^{(1)}\\
 + \frac{\partial^2 g_{ij}(\bm{x}-\bm{x'})}{\partial x_k' \partial x_l'} P_{klj}^{(2)}
 + \cdots
\end{multline}
Here $\bm{P}^{(k)}$ are the multipoles corresponds to $\bm{x'}$,
\begin{equation}
  P_j^{(0)} = \sum_{v=1}^N F_j^v = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  P_{kj}^{(1)} = \sum_{v=1}^N (l_k^v-x'_k) F_j^v = \sum_{v=1}^N l_k^v F_j^v
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
  P_{klj}^{(2)} & = \sum_{v=1}^N (l_k^v-x'_k) (l_l^v-x'_l) F_j^v \nonumber \\
  & = \sum_{v=1}^N l_k^vl_l^v F_j^v - x'_k P_{lj}^{(1)} - x'_l P_{kj}^{(1)}
\end{align}

$\bm{P}^{(1)}$ is the force dipole.
It is independent of the $\bm{x'}$ we choose.
Also, it is symmetric, because the torque on the system
\begin{equation}
  \tau_i = \sum_{v=1}^N l_j^v F_k^v - l_k^v F_j^v = P_{jk}^{(1)} - P_{kj}^{(1)} = 0
\end{equation}
Therefore, $\bm{P}^{(1)}$ is diagonalizable.

$\bm{P}^{(2)}$ depends on the choice of $\bm{x'}$.
Although we can perform multipole expansion with respect to any $\bm{x'}$, we hope our choice of $\bm{x'}$ can give a direct impression of where the defect is situated.
Therefore, we propose using the following criteria:
choose $\bm{x'}$ such that, in the basis where $\bm{P}^{(1)}$ is a diagonal matrix,
\begin{equation}
  P_{iii}^{(2)} = \sum_{v=1}^N (l_i^v-x'_i)^2 F_i^v = 0
\end{equation}
This gives an unambiguous definition for $\bm{x'}$ and also makes $\bm{x'}$ the center of the forces.
And it is consistent with the case where the symmetry is preserved.

\section{Obtaining Results From OpenKIM}
\label{app:data}
All of the results and our codes are in the OpenKIM repository.

If you only need to find out how each model performs relative to the reference data, you can

The results can be accessed through OpenKIM Query \url{query.openkim.org}.
We can obtain the results either through the web interface or through any programming language that supports HTTP requests.
The backend of this query API is a MongoDB database, and in order to obtain the results we want, we need to construct our query with the correct MongoDB syntax.
The website of MongoDB, \url{mongodb.org}, provides a detailed documentation of this.

Here is an example of using Python to obtain all the fcc Al lattice constants (TODO: replace by vacancy formation energy) calculated with various interatomic potentials:
\begin{lstlisting}
import requests
res = requests.get('https://query.openkim.org/api?flat=on&query={"meta.type":"tr","property-id":"tag:staff@noreply.openkim.org,2014-04-15:property/structure-cubic-crystal-npt","meta.runner.kimcode":{"$regex":"^LatticeConstantCubicEnergy_fcc"},"species.source-value":"Al"}&limit=0&fields={"a.source-value":1,"meta.subject.kimcode":1}&database=data').json()
\end{lstlisting}

To obtain a plot of lattice constant versus bulk modulus for all the models and all the elements, we can do
\begin{lstlisting}
import requests
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Obtain data
res_lat = pd.read_json('https://query.openkim.org/api?flat=on&query={"meta.type":"tr","property-id":"tag:staff@noreply.openkim.org,2014-04-15:property/structure-cubic-crystal-npt","meta.runner.kimcode":{"$regex":"^LatticeConstantCubicEnergy_fcc"}}&limit=0&fields={"a.source-value":1,"species.source-value":1,"meta.subject.kimcode":1}&database=data')
res_bulk = pd.read_json('https://query.openkim.org/api?flat=on&query={"meta.type":"tr","property-id":"tag:staff@noreply.openkim.org,2014-04-15:property/bulk-modulus-isothermal-cubic-crystal-npt","meta.runner.kimcode":{"$regex":"^ElasticConstantsCubic_fcc"}}&limit=0&fields={"isothermal-bulk-modulus.source-value":1,"meta.subject.kimcode":1,"species.source-value":1}&database=data')

# Merge on species and model name
res_lat['species'] = res_lat['species.source-value'].apply(lambda x: x[0])
res_bulk['species'] = res_bulk['species.source-value'].apply(lambda x: x[0])
res = pd.merge(res_lat, res_bulk, how = 'inner', on = ['meta.subject.kimcode', 'species'])

# Remove outliers
bulk = res['isothermal-bulk-modulus.source-value']
res_cleaned = res[(bulk > 0) & (bulk < 1000)]

# Plot

%Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the
%subequations environment:
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%E&=&mc, \label{appa}
%\\
%E&=&mc^2, \label{appb}
%\\
%E&\agt& mc^3. \label{appc}
%\end{eqnarray}
%\end{subequations}
%They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).

% The \nocite command causes all entries in a bibliography to be printed out
% whether or not they are actually referenced in the text. This is appropriate
% for the sample file to show the different styles of references, but authors
% most likely will not want to use it.
\nocite{*}

\bibliography{apssamp}% Produces the bibliography via BibTeX.
