    "description"  “This quantity describes the center of the elastic distortion caused by the vacancy. Mathematically, we can model the vacancy's impact to the long-range displacement field as a series of force multipoles acting on a single point in an initially unrelaxed crystal. The multipole expansion coefficients depend on our choice of the point. There is a unique point in the original unrelaxed crystal, that, in the basis where the force dipole is a diagonal matrix, the diagonal terms of the force quadruple are zeros. We define this point as the center and express its position in fractional coordinates correspond the host unit cell defined in this property. If there are several points equivalent to that point in our unit cell, we use the one with the smallest frac_x, and, if there are still several positions, we use the one with smallest frac_y, and then, smallest frac_z. The fractional coordinates chosen according to this are the value of this quantity.”
