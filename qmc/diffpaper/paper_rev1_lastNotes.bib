@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="The local energy contains one-body operators (the kinetic energy and the possibly non-local electron-nucleus potential), and the two-body electron-electron potential; the latter is diagonal in $R$ and the calculation of both its value and its derivatives is trivial."}
